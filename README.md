# smooth-shave

`smooth-shave:` an opinionated strategy for engineers who don't spend all day on ML or AI to engage in the cutting edge applications of LLM inference at the edge. 

The current repo is heavily focsued on the `M1 MacBook Pro`, but there is no reason why other hosts, machines, and runtimes cannot take advantage of the content within.

The name `smooth-shave` is inspired by inference at the edge, llamas, an imaginary llama-fur coat, and also something that has good sticking power and easy recall.
